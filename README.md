# -Air-quality-prediction-
Developed a predictive model for air pollution levels in various regions based on historical air quality data.
## Goal
To create a system that can accurately forecast the concentration of key air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM), and suspended particulate matter (SPM). The prediction model should take into account various environmental factors and provide insights into the potential air quality index (AQI) values.
